# 🎮 Game Launch Marketing Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **data-driven marketing analysis** to select the best game for launch. Using consumer survey data, we evaluate player segmentation, market demand, and pricing strategies to identify the most promising game title. Through exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and predictive modeling, we assess player engagement, willingness to pay, and revenue potential. The final recommendation balances audience demand, competitive positioning, and business objectives to optimize the go-to-market strategy.

📢 **Note:** This project is for educational purposes. The survey data and game publisher are fictional, designed to simulate real-world marketing analysis.
